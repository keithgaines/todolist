## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript Local Storage

### What I learned

Through completing the To Do List project, I gained experience working with JavaScript, jQuery, and localStorage. I learned how to add event listeners and handle form submissions, dynamically create and modify HTML elements, and store and retrieve data using localStorage. I also developed problem-solving skills and learned how to effectively use console.log and other debugging techniques to troubleshoot issues. Overall, this project provided a great opportunity to apply my programming knowledge in a practical way and further develop my skills.

### Continued development

As part of my continued development, I aim to deepen my understanding of jQuery and DOM manipulation. I have found that these skills are essential for developing dynamic and interactive web applications. By further developing my knowledge in these areas, I hope to be able to build more complex and sophisticated web applications that provide a better user experience. I plan to continue practicing my skills in jQuery and DOM manipulation by working on projects that challenge me and push my understanding of these topics.

## Acknowledgments

Shoutout to Brad Traversy for his course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS, & JavaScript" on Udemy. This helped me really understand how to use JavaScript to work with local storage and the overall JS logic of the project. From his example (written in vanilla JS), I was able to understand the concept enough to re-write it myself into JQuery.
